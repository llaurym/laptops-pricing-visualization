## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores key factors influencing the price of laptops by analyzing various technical specifications and how they correlate with price differences. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that can:
- Help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.
- Provide insights for manufacturers on pricing strategies.
- Identify trends across different brands and specifications.

## 📊 Research Questions
- How do different hardware features (e.g., GPU type, secondary storage, screen resolution) impact laptop pricing?
- Are certain features consistently associated with higher prices across different brands?
- Do specific brands follow distinct pricing strategies based on hardware specifications?

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **991 distinct laptops** sourced from the "Smartprix" website. It contains **22 variables** detailing specifications such as:
- **Price (converted to USD)**
- **Brand & Model**
- **CPU brand & performance tier**
- **Number of cores & threads**
- **RAM capacity**
- **Primary & secondary storage types and capacities**
- **GPU type (integrated vs. dedicated)**
- **Screen size & resolution**
- **Touchscreen availability**
- **Operating system**
- **Warranty information**

### 🔑 Key Variables
| Variable Name      | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Price_USD`       | Price converted from INR to USD |
